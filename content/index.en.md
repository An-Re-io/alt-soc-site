# Manifesto

**We** are those who choose freedom over submission.

Connection — over power.

Mutual aid — over oppression.

**We are a community that chooses to live beyond hierarchies, markets, and states.** We do not wait for change from society or the state — we take our lives into our own hands, here and now.

**Our goal is not protest for the sake of protest**, but the creation of a viable alternative: horizontal, resilient, and free.

**Where there is no center, no top, no hierarchy** — only a circle, mutual aid, and creativity.

**We do not accept the notion that hierarchy is natural** — where there is hierarchy, there is oppression.
We reject capitalism, because capitalism serves not people, but itself.

Our currency is trust and mutual aid.

Our resources are skills, land, and knowledge.

We do not ask for permission.

We do not aim to please.

We simply — are.

If you feel you can breathe this air —

**Welcome home.**
