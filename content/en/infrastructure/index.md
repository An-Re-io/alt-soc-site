## Our Virtual Space

To achieve our goals, we use our own network built on top of the internet — [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). Within it, we host our resources: forums, file archives, servers, personal pages, and repositories.

## Software

We use only free and open-source software — everything made by people, for people.

## Content

We follow the principles of DIY and free creativity, without censorship or restrictions. Any creative work can be personal or collective — the choice lies with the creator(s). All content produced by us is freely distributed within our community, and may be monetized for people outside the community at the creator's discretion.
