## The World Around Us

We strive to live in harmony with nature — to respect and protect it, as we are part of it.
At the same time, we do not promote technophobia or the rejection of technology and civilization. On the contrary, we believe that technology, when used for good and without harming the environment, can not only improve human life, but also help restore the balance between humanity and nature — not only destroy, but rebuild and preserve its integrity.

## Freedom of Information

This is one of our core values and aspirations. We aim to unite people who value and support the freedom of all information. Information becomes dangerous only when it is mishandled or used with the intent to harm others.

## Free Relationships

For us, free relationships are, above all, about mutual respect and the observance of personal boundaries — about freedom of love and self-expression. They must not be constrained by rigid rules or doctrines.
Only the individual decides whom to love, how to love, and what kind of relationships they wish to build.
One thing matters above all: to remember that one's freedom ends where another's begins.
Polygamy, monogamy, homosexual/bisexual/heterosexual relationships, non-committal relationships — all are simply ways to love.

## Our Philosophy

Awareness of oneself as part of the natural order of being and nature.

Nonviolence, spontaneity, and the natural path.

The separation of personal passions and the awareness of oneself as part of a natural process — recognizing one’s place on the scale that constantly seeks balance.
To understand that nothing in this world is superfluous — only extremes exist.
We do not claim our ideology to be the only true one — it is merely a response to current realities, to the pervasive drive for control, oppression, and hierarchy.
We seek liberation from social conventions and a broadened perception of the world around us.
Not struggle — but the search for alternatives.

## Our Stance on Hierarchy

We reject the concept of hierarchy as an inherent part of any organized structure, and as the only "natural" or "correct" way to live, solve problems, or achieve goals.

We understand that not everyone is ready for self-organization or to exist without hierarchy — it requires self-discipline, emotional maturity, and a sense of responsibility for oneself and those around them.
But those who are ready to build their lives independently — who are unwilling to hand over their freedom and lives to third parties, unwilling to tolerate initiatives that serve the powerful, and who understand that oppression is an inherent part of any hierarchical system — will likely find resonance in our views.

**Core principles include:**

* Horizontal relationships
* A commitment to nonviolence
* The rejection of all forms of oppression: nationalism, sexism, racism, patriarchy, and class inequality

## Communism

**We are not a far-left collective**, as communism and its various branches also rely on oppression — specifically, the suppression of individual identity in favor of collective interests.

It is important for a person to recognize themselves as an individual within society, just as it is important to be part of a social group, a collective, a community.

We do not believe that all private property inherently triggers class inequality.
The desire to be wealthier stems not from the mere ability to possess property or resources, but from the pursuit of power or happiness through material accumulation.

However, we do believe that if private property is needed to satisfy individual needs, then collective property and communal resources are just as necessary to meet the needs of the group.
